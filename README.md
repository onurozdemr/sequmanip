# Solving Sequential Manipulation Puzzles by Finding Easier Subproblems

Goal of this work is to solve sequential manipulation problems using subproblem decomposition.
It will be inspired by the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02053


The finalized codes are in final_single_agent.py and bottleneck.py

The environment (.g file) can be specified inside final_single_agent.py, to the "task" field/variable, before the algorithm starts

To run, write "python3 final_single_agent.py" to the terminal
